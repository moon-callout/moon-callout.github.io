    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>Haunted Rainbow(Us), Syrenis, And Moonlight were dating/partner systems with each other for months before they broke it off with us both. We(Us and Moon) broke it off with Syrenis first, during August, and they(Moon) broke it off with Us in Late September.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Syrenis Situation</h2>
    <p>On August 20th, 2023, Syrenis joined murder mystery 2 to play with a friend of theirs who at the time was dating Moon. Since Moon blocked Syrenis on roblox, they were not aware Moon was in the same game. Moon did not like that Syrenis was in the same game server as them, and so they proceeded to harass them, tell them that they hope their abusive brother finishes them off, and tell them to kill themselves.
